# ATF's eRegs
This repository contains code necessary to run an Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ([ATF](https://www.atf.gov)) instance of
[eRegulations](https://eregs.github.io), a regulation parser, API, and viewer.
As such, it includes glue to connect various general purpose libraries
together in addition to ATF-specific styles, templates, and plugins. 

Check out the [eRegulations project overview](https://eregs.github.io/) and [our contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
