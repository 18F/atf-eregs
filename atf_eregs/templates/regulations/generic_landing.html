<h4 tabindex="0" class="important">Legal limitations of this tool</h4>

<p>The ATFâ€™s eRegulations tool is an editorial compilation of material and not
an official legal edition of the
{% external_link url="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/cfr/" text="Code of Federal Regulations" %}
or the
{% external_link url="https://www.federalregister.gov/" text="Federal Register" %}.
We have made every effort to ensure the material presented in this tool is
accurate, but if you are relying on it for legal research you should
{% external_link url="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=userinfo" text="consult the official editions of those sources" %}
to confirm your findings. Nothing in this tool binds ATF or creates any
rights, benefits, or defenses, substantive or procedural, that are enforceable
by any party in any manner.</p>
