Generally, we like all of the content in the generic_landing, but we _would_
like to provide a consistent disclaimer. Overextends tells django to use the
`regulations-site` provided template

<p>The ATFâ€™s eRegulations tool is an editorial compilation of material and not
an official legal edition of the Code of Federal Regulations or the Federal
Register. We have made every effort to ensure the material presented in this
tool is accurate, but if you are relying on it for legal research you should
consult the official editions of those sources to confirm your findings.
Nothing in this tool binds ATF or creates any rights, benefits, or defenses,
substantive or procedural, that are enforceable by any party in any
manner.</p>
